GearSwap files for FFXI

I'm a novice when it comes to GearSwap, and this is that attempt.

Equipment sets are laid out in an attempt to depict how it would look like in the equipment screen ingame:
  main, sub, range, ammo
  head, neck, ear1, ear2
  body, hands, ring1, ring2
  back, waist, legs, feet
